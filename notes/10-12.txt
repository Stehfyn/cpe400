Midterm Review: Practice Problems:
alpha standard is 0.125

EstimatedRTT(.25) = 59
Timeout (0.25) = 79

7 14 21 22 23 24
cwnd = 12, ss threshold = 12
ss threshold = 7, cwnd = 1

l/r = 1000/5000 = .2s
,8

generalized:
(.2 * n-1 )+ .4

l/r * h + l/r * (h-1)

a)routing
c).application layer

2|network comgestion, router buffer full,  checksum, , c). alpha close to 1 when high consistent fluctuations, small alpha when things are stable keep it close to convergence
3|a). packet sniffing, learning through analysis, experimental purpose,  b).promiscuous mode means a computer will accept a packet regardless if its the intended target, then passes it on c).
technology adv: network research and learning disadv: knowledge can be misused
legal adv: network forensics disadv: surveillance, lack of non-repudiation
ethics adv: optimize network performance disadv: personal privacy

FTP| SMTP
Serviced by TCP, as that favors data integrity
http: port 90
dns port 53
smtp 55
ftp 20 and 21
21 is control connection
20 is data conenction
this is referred to out of bounds communication
two seperate channels
chat systems historically irc 
now realtime messaging ??
