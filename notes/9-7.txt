Network edge:
clients<->servers

servers:
data centers or someone's garage

Access networks:
wired, wireless communication links

Network core:
interconnected routers
network of networks

tcp udp = transport

all other protocols are application

address resolution protocol = link layer

network acts like a set of vertices of a graph
modeled complete connected graph
O(n^2), does not scale
solution?

layers of service based in core ISPs
still not the solution to prevent monopolization

layers of multiple core ISPs, connected by internet exchange points by non profit organization

google(tier 1, tier2, IXP)

IXP=peering linkes

regional ISP used to reduce complexity in vertices

NAT network address translation, network layer
NAT routers responsible for packet mangling

Content provider networks:



192.168.1.x = 256 devices = 2^8

10.x.x.x = 2^24 devicesUNR = 18000 to 30000 individual ips


tier2, tier3 don't talk to another

TTL is used for an attempt at preemptiveness
decrement some value, hits 0, QoS, current router discards

tracert takes advantage of ttl, 0 gives error response to source.

Performance:
packet loss avg, ethernet 10^-12
wireless 10^-6

configure NIC

promiscuousness compliance
