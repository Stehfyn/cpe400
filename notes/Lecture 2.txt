iso layer


PACKET SWITCHING
link layer===========
hubs (earlier) -> switches (layer)
no buffering, data collision (hubs), simplex(one channel)
port buffering, bi-directional (duplex, in and out simultaneously into a port) talk and listen at same time

wireless is simplex communication, as it needs to filter,
psuedo duplex when using two different bandwidths

network layer===========
routers (even smarter)
prepares packets to reduce latency and increase throughput, finds the right direction

COMMUNICATION LINKS
fiber, copper, radio, satellite
transmission rate (bandwidth)
bandiwidth bounds:
-loss
-delay
-throughput

network components:
-devices
-relays
-links

Business view:
-network of interconnected ISPs

ISP type:
-3rd tier (layer3) subsidiary provider
-2nd tier(layer2) intermediary provider
-1st tier(layer1) Core provider

method - IEEE standard:
Wifi (802.11)
Ethernet(CAT3)
Bluetooth(802.15)

standards:
IEEE
IETF task force

hardware view
service view, isp relationship to tiers, programming interface, their infra (client server, accepts connection over a well known port)
coverage sclae view: lan coverage, wireless signal coverage, satellite coverage
communication type view: wireless, bluetooth
operational view:  protocols

port (is a gate in our computer through which things get exchanged)
-16 bit field (0-65535)

programming interface:
hooks-allow apps to connect i.e. use transport service

coverage scale:
LAN (local area) 10-1,000m
PAN (personal area) 1- 10, 30m
MAN (metropolitan) 1-100km
WAN (wide area) 100-1000km
Global (internet) 10,000km


MAN uses shared buses
-algorithms to manage collision (simultaneous communication) Uses more battery, delay, less throughput

batch ("tracert google.com")
sends 3 UDP packets
similar to ping google.com
but replies packet hop info

ping (RTT) 

UNR
-1287 access points
-internet2

communication types:
-unicasting
-broadcasting
-multicasting

single target transmit
indiscrminant transmit
semi-discriminant transmit

communication protocol:
-the rules of transmit, reception

protocols define:
-date format
-order of msgs
-actions taken on transmission, receipt

millions, billions of components:
-hosts
-routers
-access networks
-physical links

How to manage such vast amount of components?
Divide functionalities among multiple layers, defined in the 5 layers in the internet protocol stack (TCP/IP stack)

-application (includes presentation and session layer)
	-support host/net apps
	-email, ftp, http
-transport
	-process-process data transfer
	-tcp, udp
-network
	-routing of packets from src<->destination
	-ip address, routing protocols
-link
	-data transfer between neighboring elements
	-ethernet, wifi, lte
-physical
	-bits "on the wire"
 
Advantage of layering?
	1. Reduce the design complexity

Encapsulation/Decapsulation
Messages->Segements->Datagrams->Frames (Encapsulation)

Server side port
HTTP: 80
DNS: 53
SMTP: 25
FTP: 20, 21

transport: ports info
network: ips addr
link: mac addr, next mac
physical: packet transmit

routers strip network layer and add new packet header with direction info
replies from destination-> protocol dependent
