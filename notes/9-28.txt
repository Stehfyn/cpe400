rdt
reliable data transfer'

3 scenarios triggering timeout
-packet loss
-acknoledgement loss
-packet delay


\Selective Repeat:
window size <= half of the max sequence number

RDT Mechanisms:
Acknowledgement
Timer
Sequence Number
Pipelining
Checksum


TCP
Sequence number is the index of the first byte of it is packet
acknowledgement number response is the index of the next byte in the stream, next byte in the stream is the highest priority byte yet to be received
Response of TCP is capable of cumulative Ack, multiple sends mapped to one response
NextTCP bytestream size is determined by ack number and receiver window buffer that indicates the emptiness of the receiver buffer

TCP 6 flags in TCP bytestream attacker/defender
S-sin flag, only first pakcet will have sin flag set
F-fin flag, end communication in a gracious way
R-Hard kill, resest flag
A-acknowledgment flag
U-Argent flag
P-Push, like force send asap
