Security
The state of well-being of information and infrastructure in which the possibility of malintent  or disruption of info/services is kept low or tolerable

Network Security:
	design of architectures
	how baddies can attack
	how we can defend

internet usually designed with security in mind
protocol designers play catch up


Security primitives: (how a secure channel is created)
	no one algorithm in which all 6 are vulnerable
	Alice/bob everything that isn't malware or an intruder
	
	Alice's Online Bak( CIA ) 
		Prevent Trudy from seeing Bob's balance
			Confidentiality(prevent unauth reading) | Encryption protocols
		
		Trudy must not be able to change Bob's balance
		Bob must no be able to improperly change his own balance
			Integrity(prevent unauth writing) | Hashing?

		AOB's information must be available when needed
			Availability (data is available in a timely manner when needed)
				Denial of Service is prominent, as there's no algorithm or pattern against
		
	
		===========================================================

		How does bob's computer know that bob is really bob and trudy
		when bob logs into aob. how does aob know bob
			Authentication(assurance that other party is the claimed one)
	
		Bob can't view someone else's account
		or install new software
			Authorization (allowing access only to permitted resources)
		
		Bob can't deny a transaction he requested
		"no takebacks"
			Non-repudiation (protection against denial by one of the parties in a communication)


SHA 256
key for hashinh

authentication and authorization


Threats and attacks

threat(possibility)
	vulnerability
	flaw

attack(execution)
	active vs.passive

Security services are designed to prevent, detect, or recover from a security attacl
	Firewall, IDS, Digital Forensics

Security at rest
Security in transit
	must be maintained from both sides


Attacker potential

malware, spyware, virus or worms
botnet for dos
dns attack

packet sniffing
	broadcast mesia
	promiscuous network interfaces
ip sniffing
	

Firewall (first line of defense)
	separate local network from internet
	

	techniques
		service control: determination of service type
		direction control: properly allowed or blocked/inbound our outbound, conditionally accessed
		
		User control: Control access to a service based on user
			typically applied to users inside the firewall
		behavior control: behavior of serrvices

	Firewall needs to exist between trusted and untrusted networks
	Internal networks have additional layers of firewalls
	on user end machines
	layering of firewalls

	internal DMZ networks, basically a buffer of computation for negotiation
	Distributed firewall configurations
	

Intrustion Detection Systems (IDS) 2nd line of defence
	incredibly specific targeted monitoring, and is aware of instrinsic network topology
	

	Methods:
		Statistical anomaly detection
			statistically model and define proper behavior
			define suspicious and unsuspicious behavior
			
			correlation testing
			regression testing
			automation used to patch a firewall breach, as opposed to intense, laborious multi-organization collaboration
		Rule-based detection
			Rule-set laws

Honeypot (inverse security)
	takes advantages of an attacker leaning towards taking the first route they see inside
	
with the advent of data analysis through machine learning, honeypots and 
adversarial networks towards directing output to automatically path first line of defense threat analysis, threat intelligence exchange.
if a process can be taught, then a process can be untaught
