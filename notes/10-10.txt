TCP Congestion Control:
TCP Reno <-> TCP Tahoe
1. Timeout	1. Timeour
2. Triple Duplicate Acknowledgements

TCP New Reno
TCP Congestion Control is top 10 networking problem
is integration of tahoe and reno

TCP Tahoe
1. cwnd hits ss threshold...additive increase..., then cwnd := 1, threshold = cwnd/2

TCP Reno
TCP Congestion control: Sawtooth recovery pattern

Initial ss threshold = 14
First loss occurrence = 9 transmission phases
what is the next cwnd and ssthreshold at 10th phase


ss = 14
1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 15, 7:16, 8:17, 9:18 ==> 18/2 --> 9
cwnd = 1. ss transmission window = 18/2

Initial ss threshold = 17
cwnd := 1
loss occurs after 6 transmissions, detected by 3 dupacks. ==> TCP Reno
What is the next cwnd and ss threshold?
After 4 more transmissions again loss occurs, detcted by timeout, what is the next cwnd and ss threshold?

1 2 4 8 16 17 ==> floor(17/2) ==> 8, cwnd, ss ==> 8
8 9 10 11 ==> floor(11/5) ==> 5, cwnd ==> 1, ss ==> 5, cwnd is 1 because it was detected by timeout

Restart:
TCP Tahoe, slow start again
TCP Reno, additive increase

congestion "do not clog the pipe"
flow control "do not overwhelm the receiving buffer"

TCP Flow Control:
16-bit field of TCP Segment structure, ==> receiver window size, (how much that buffer is free)


we use UDP for speed, research, and diagnostics (control communication)
DNS over UDP

minimum header size:
UDP: 8 bytes, 2 32 bit segments
TCP: 20 bytes: 5 32 bit segments


5 properties reliability
checksum
acknowledgement
pipelining
