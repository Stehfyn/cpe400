#of hosts( 2^24)-2class a
minus 2 is because of reserved control ip addresses
x.0.0.0 (id of subnet)
x.255.255.255 (id of broadcast address)

class a 			1.0.0.0 
class b 			128.0.0.0
class c 			192.0.0.0
class d multicasting 	234.0.0.0
class e experimental 	240.0.0.0

q1. 200 hosts, what class to use?
class c, we need to optimize ip reuse, (2^8)-12253 hosts available

q2. 1000 hosts, what class to use?
class b, we need to optimize ip reuse, (2^16)-2 65534 hosts available

first
classful addressing (still use implicitly, because the resulting CIDR is still in some class range)

next
CIDR
classless Inter domain routing (we use explicitly) (not fixed slider, reduces wasting of ips in 32 bit range)
-subnet portion of address is arbitrary length
-address format is a.b.c.d/x where x is # of bits in subnet portion of address

200.23.16.0/23
subnet part			host part
11001000 00010111 0001 000|0 00000000

(2^9) -2 = 510 hosts available

q2.revisited: use (2^10)
(2^10)-2 = 1022
network mask is: /22(netmask)

net vs. subnet

gateway into network. network can have multiple subnest with their own gateways, and interconnected.
each subnet needs a subnet mask
subnet masks need to be higher than parent network mask

cmd:
ipconfig /all

ip address reuse:
dhcp and nat

dynamic host configuration protocol
-dynamically get address from server, assigned and has a lease time
-dhcp server keeps track of used ips and whats available
-dhcp uses udp over ip over ether, application layer protocol. Facilitates network layer

dhcp uses 4-way handshake
-discover
-offer
-request
-ack

subnet calculator




home router is link layer switch
network gateway
and is dhcp server

bssid: individual accesspoint
essid: unifies accesspoint through mask.
uses singular backbone communication to retrieve ips from dhcp server
